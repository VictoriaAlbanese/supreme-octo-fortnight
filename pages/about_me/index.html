				<h1> Well, if you must know... </h1> 
				<p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the 
				   University of Massachusetts Lowell, pursuing my 
				   bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with minors
				   in both Robotics and Mathematics.  Here, check out
				   <a href="resume.html">my resume</a>!</p>
				<p>I am consistently commended by my professors for 
				   my programming ability, and I am known by both my 
				   peers and my coworkers as a self-starter and a team 
				   player.  I always strive to exceed expectations, both 
				   in the classroom and in the workplace.  As you 
				   might be able to tell by my minors and this lovely 
				   site, I have special interests in both robotics and 
				   web design.</p>
				<p>My professional side aside, I love Star Wars (as is 
				   evinced by the leftmost image), Harry Potter, Doctor 
				   Who, classic works of fiction such as Pride and 
				   Prejudice and The Great Gatsby, music by The Piano 
				   Guys, jigsaw puzzles, tap dancing (which I have done 
				   since I was three), and all things Disney.</p>
