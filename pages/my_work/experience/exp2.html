				<p class="info line1">Omtool, Ltd. | Andover, MA </p>
				<p class="info">May 2014 - January 2015 { 8 months } </p>

				<p>This job was my first experience working at a real company.  My 
				uncle, who is a software engineer Omtool, was my mentor for my senior 
				project, and was so happy with my work that at the end I was offered 
				an internship at his company. I worked here the summer after my senior 
				year of high school, and my during my first winter break at college.  
				The breaks in my employment were so I could focus on my education. </p>

				<p>During my time at Omtool, in which I was very new to writing code, 
				I helped design, develop, implement, and maintain automated UI tests 
				for existing programs by using QAlibers Test Builder, a drag and drop,
				slightly outdated test building program.  I also participated in 
				weekly SCRUM meetings, and was able to communicate and collaborate 
				insightfully and effectively with my coworkers. </p>

				<p>There is so much that I learned at Omtool, the biggest thing perhaps 
				being simply how it feels to work at a company.  Having coworkers and 
				interacting with them, and seeing how they interact with each other to 
				fix bugs and build a project and work towards a goal was really cool.  
				Familiarizing myself with all of the stages of writing, reviewing, 
				testing, and pushing code to a version control system was also super 
				valuable. In addition, working primarily with a nearly obsolete program 
				required a lot of dedication, motivation, and independant research, 
				which showed me that I can work successfully on my own to teach myself 
				new skills. </p>
