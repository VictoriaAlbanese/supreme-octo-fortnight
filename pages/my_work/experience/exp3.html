				<p class="info line1">UMass Lowell Robotics Lab | Lowell, MA </p>
				<p class="info">June 2015  -  August 2015 { 3 months } </p>

				<p>When I was accepted to the University of Massachusetts Lowell, I was awarded 
				a scholarship where I would co-op with one of the professors for 10 weeks over 
				the summer and in turn be paid $4000.  I was so beyond excited when a spot at the 
				robotics lab and the opportunity to work under Holly Yanco opened up! As a result 
				of this job, I got offered my next job during my next semester in school.</p>

				<p>In the lab, my coworker, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderinfantino">
				Alexander Infantino</a>, and I designed and developed programs written in C++ which 
				enable a NAO Robot to detect and react to its environment with its sensors, and to
				perform specific tasks, including standing up when it has fallen down, avoiding 
				obstacles when navigating a room, walking, talking, and even hula dancing!  All of 
				this was implemented utilizing Robot Operating System (ROS) on a Linux operating 
				system. </p>

				<p>I learned so many skills at this job.  Not only did I really get to excercise my 
				knowledge of coding that I had, by that time, built up, but I really got to expand 
				and refine my ability to work in a linux environment.  Learning to use vim and Github 
				was really valuable, and using ROS, the most widely used platform for robots, will 
				definitely come in very useful during the course of my career.  Above all, the 
				opportunity to work with robots in such a hands-on environment really enforced to me 
				that robotics is a path that I'm very interested in following. </p>
