				<p class="info line1">UML Engaging Computing Group | Lowell, MA </p>
				<p class="info">February 2016  -  Present { 1 year and counting! } </p>

				<p>I got this job through the recommendation of a friend.  After a brief 
				interview, I started working at the lab that very day.  I am still working 
				at the lab today, however during the summers, I do not work in the lab, 
				preferring instead to get some real world experience at companies. </p>

				<p>As a member of the Engaging Computing Group (ECG), a research lab at 
				the University of Massachustees Lowell run by Professor Fred Martin, I am 
				working on helping to update and maintain the iSENSE Project, a web system 
				for collecting, visualizing, and sharing data.  I identify and fix bugs 
				in Ruby, Coffeescript, HTML, and CSS code, and am gaining practical experience 
				with web development.  I was also responsible for crafting a series of video 
				tutorials to replace the extremely outdated and disorganized former ones.</p>

				<p>I was also given the opportunity to present with the ECG at the 2016 USA 
				Science and Engineering Festival (USASEF), giving demos of the website and 
				featured projects to hundreds of parents and children at the event to engage 
				them in and show them the importance of data visualization. </p>

				<p>There's a lot that I'm learning in the ECG lab.  I'm mostly learning how 
				to locate bugs in code that I haven't written, and then patch them up.  I am
				will also be learning a bit of Coffescript, a permutation of javascript, and 
				Ruby on Rails.  Putting my critical thinking to the test to solve problems in 
				this lab has been something that I am grateful for. </p>
