				<h1>Software Developer</h1>
				<p>UML Engaging Computing Group | Lowell, MA <br/>
				   February 2016  -  Present <br/> 
				   { 5 months and counting! } </p>
				<p>I got this job through the recommendation of a friend.
				   After a brief interview, I started working at the lab that 
				   very day.  I am still working at the lab today, however 
				   during the summer, I am taking a break from the lab to 
				   get some real world experience at a robotics company. </p>
				<p>As a member of the Engaging Computing Group (ECG), 
				   a research lab at the University of Massachustees Lowell 
				   run by Professor Fred Martin, I am working on helping to 
				   update and maintain the iSENSE Project, a web system 
				   for collecting, visualizing, and sharing data.  I identify and 
				   fix bugs in HTML and CSS code, and am gaining 
				   practical experience with web development.  I was also 
				   responsible for crafting a series of video tutorials to 
				   replace the extremely outdated and <br/> 
				   disorganized former ones.</p>
				<p>I was also given the opportunity to present with the ECG 
				   at the 2016 USA Science and Engineering Festival 
				   (USASEF), giving demos of the website and featured 
				   projects to hundreds of parents and children at the event 
				   to engage them in and show them the importance <br/>
				   of data visualization. </p>
				<p>There's a lot that I'm learning in the ECG lab.  I'm mostly 
				   learning how to locate bugs in code that I haven't 
				   written, and then patch them up.  I will also be learning 
				   how to use coffescript, a permutation of javascript.  
				   Putting my critical thinking to the test to solve problems
				   in this lab has been something that I am grateful for. </p>
