				<p>This amazing experience was born of my previous co-op work in the robotics lab; when 
				my coworker, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderinfantino">
				Alexander Infantino</a>, and I, were presenting what we had done for the summer, Dr. 
				Momotaz Begum approached us o inspect our work and, as her research involved the use 
				of NAO Robots and she liked what she saw, offered us a job doing research under her 
				graduate students, which we were only too happy to accept.  Our time doing research 
				under her ended after one semester due to a lack of funding. </p>

				<p>Working in a team conducting research under Dr. Momotaz Begum in the areas of 
				Intelligent Assistive Technology and Human Robot Interaction, at this job I contributing 
				to the development of a machine learning algorithm which will enable a NAO Robot to 
				autonomously deliver therapy to children with autism spectrum disorders.  I did this by 
				programming the NAO Robot in C++ to perform specific tasks which would contribute to the 
				final algorithm, utilizing Robot Operating System (ROS) to accomplish this.  At the end
				of it all, I cowrote a program which harvests and timestamps visual and audio data from 
				the NAO's sensors, and I indepandantly wrote a program which integrates facial recognition 
				and name matching to the nao's cameras, resulting in a cool "Who Am I?" demo. </p>

				<p>This semester I really learned how to balance well a full courseload with a part time 
				job.  Being able to juggle the stress of classes with the added stress of work was a 
				challenge, but I really accomplished and learned a lot.  I continued to grow comfortable 
				with C++, Linux, ROS, and Github, and in addition, I learned a lot about OpenCV in my 
				work with face detection and recognition. </p>
