				<h1>Research Assistant</h1>
				<p>UMass Lowell Robotics Lab | Lowell, MA <br/>
				   September 2015  -  December 2015 <br/> 
				   { 4 months } </p>
				<p>This amazing experience was born of my previous
				   co-op work in the robotics lab; when my coworker, 
				   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderinfantino">Alexander Infantino</a>, and I, were presenting what
				   we had done for the summer, Momotaz Begum approached us 
				   to inspect our work and, as her research involved the  
				   use of NAO Robots and she liked what she saw, offered
				   us a job doing research under her grad students, which
				   we were only too happy to accept.  Our time doing research
				   under her ended after one semester due to a lack of funding. </p>
				<p>Working in a team conducting research under Dr. Momotaz 
				   Begum in the areas of Intelligent Assistive Technology 
				   and Human Robot Interaction, at this job I contributing to 
				   the development of a machine learning algorithm which will 
				   enable a NAO Robot to autonomously deliver therapy to 
				   children with autism spectrum disorders.  I did this by 
				   programming the NAO Robot in C++ to perform specific tasks 
				   which would contribute to the final algorithm, utilizing 
				   Robot Operating System (ROS) to accomplish this.  At the end
				   of it all, I cowrote a program which harvests and timestamps
				   visual and audio data from the NAO's sensors, and I 
				   indepandantly wrote a program which integrates facial 
				   recognition and name matching to the nao's cameras, resulting
				   in a cool "Who Am I?" demo. </p>
				<p>This semester I really learned how to balance well
				   a full courseload with a part time job.  Being able to juggle
				   the stress of classes with the added stress of work was a 
				   a challenge, but I really accomplished and learned a lot.
				   I continued to grow comfortable with C++, Linux, ROS, and
				   Github, and in addition, I learned a lot about OpenCV
				   in my work with face detection and recognition. </p>
