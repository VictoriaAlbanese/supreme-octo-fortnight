				<p class="info line1">Symbotic LLC | Wilmington, MA </p>
				<p class="info">June 2016  -  August 2016 { 3 months } </p>

				<p>I am so completely excited to have worked at Symbotic, and am even more 
				excited at the prospect of returning this summer. The people that I met there 
				are so amazing, the facilities are excellent, and the robots are super cool. </p>

				<p>I am in the Co-op Scholars program at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, 
				and it is through this program that I got my summer job.  I attended an informational 
				session about the company, and had the excellent opportunity to do a one-on-one resume 
				review with Chad Gambino (who later became my manager).  After interviewing with some 
				of the head software engineers and touring the facilities, I was offered the job. </p>

				<p>During my time here, I created a “Life of an Order” web application, which 
				searches a database and parses log files to display data and metrics on the lifetime 
				of an order through a warehouse automation system.  I was responsible for both front-end 
				design with HTML and CSS and back-end development using C#, ASP.NET, Razor, and NancyFX. 
				The project was unit tested to 100% code coverage, utilizing tools like NUnit and Moq.</p>

				<p>I learned loads at this company.  First and foremost, I learned how important it is 
				to design your program before diving right in.  Here, I produced sequence and class 
				diagrams as part of extensive architectural design prior to the project’s start.  In 
				addition, I learned how to make my program completely extensible.  I also underwent 
				intensive Agile and Scrum training, attending a formal workshop, and then grooming, 
				pointing, and completing stories during two-week sprints using Version One, also 
				participated actively in retrospectives and standups.

				<p>I know I learned a lot, and I know I was able to contribute positively and 
				meaningfully to the company.  I look forward to being able to do so again!</p>
