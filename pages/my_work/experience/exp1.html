				<h1>Technical Support</h1>
				<p>Haverhill High School iSchool | Haverhill, MA <br/>
				   September 2013  -  May 2014 <br/> 
				   { 2 months } </p>
				<p>This experience was half class and half job.  I interviewed 
				   for the dual opportunity to learn and to teach others 
				   during my senior year, and was one of the few people 
				   picked to ba a part of the tech support team.  My time at 
				   the iSchool ended when I graduated High School. </p>
				<p>At this job, I provided technical support to customers  
				   (both students and teachers at the school) by identifying 
				   problems, researching solutions, and guiding the 
				   customer through corrective steps, both in person and 
				   over the phone.  In addition to this, I also helped to 
				   manage, issue, and maintain the carts full of iPads and 
				   laptops that we had at our school, making sure they were 
				   where they needed to go and that they were returned in 
				   good condition.  I also performed inventory functions on 
				   newly purchased iPads and other tech-related materials. </p>
				<p>There is so much that I learned during my time at the 
				   iSchool. I was taught how to make a succinct, visually 
				   pleasing, powerful powerpoint presentation, and how to 
				   make an even better prezi.  How to use Google Forms and 
				   how to visualize the resulting data, and how to create 
				   custom styles in word processing applications were also 
				   some of the other things I learned.  Another meaningful 
				   project  was the creation of a few video tutorials, which 
				   gave me experience writing scripts, doing voice 
				   recordings and screen captures, and editing everything 
				   together into a successful video. </p>
