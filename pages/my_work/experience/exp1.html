				<p class="info line1">Haverhill High School iSchool | Haverhill, MA </p>
				<p class="info">September 2013  -  May 2014 { 9 months } </p>

				<p>This experience was half class and half job.  I interviewed for 
				the dual opportunity to learn and to teach others during my senior year, 
				and was one of the few people picked to ba a part of the tech support 
				team.  My time at the iSchool ended when I graduated High School. </p>

				<p>At this job, I provided technical support to customers (both students 
				and teachers at the school) by identifying problems, researching 
				solutions, and guiding the customer through corrective steps, both in 
				person and over the phone.  In addition to this, I also helped to 
				manage, issue, and maintain the carts full of iPads and laptops that 
				we had at our school, making sure they were where they needed to go and 
				that they were returned in good condition.  I also performed inventory 
				functions on newly purchased iPads and other tech-related materials. </p>

				<p>There is so much that I learned during my time at the iSchool. I was 
				taught how to make a succinct, visually pleasing, powerful powerpoint 
				presentation, and how to make an even better prezi.  How to use Google 
				Forms and how to visualize the resulting data, and how to create custom 
				styles in word processing applications were also some of the other things 
				I learned.  Another meaningful project  was the creation of a few video 
				tutorials, which gave me experience writing scripts, doing voice recordings 
				and screen captures, and editing everything together into a successful 
				video.</p>
