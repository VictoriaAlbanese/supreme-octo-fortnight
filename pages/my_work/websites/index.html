				<p>Generate Creativity was my senior project from high school: 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.ws/generatecreativity/">
				click here</a> to check it out!  It is a series of text generators I 
				wrote in javascript.  The site as a whole is designed to help provide 
				writers with creative inspiration, and the color palette and other 
				features were designed to mirror that.  The entire project took 80+ 
				hours to create. </p>
				
				<p>To learn everything you could possibly want to know about William 
				Faulkner's classic novel <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, take a look at 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.ws/bundrenfamilywebsite/">
				this</a> site I made .  I crafted this website as a class project for 
				my AP Literature and Composition class my junior year of high school.  
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-morfill-6b4376b5">
				Katherine Alice Morfill</a>, my good friend, also contributed to the 
				content of the site, but the code behind it is all me. </p>
				
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.ws/hogwartshouses/">Click 
				here</a> to look at my first website, made also in my junior year of high 
				school, a site designed around the Hogwarts Houses.  It was the website 
				design class that this was a project for that first sparked my interest in 
				computer science.  While it is by no means my best work, it is included here 
				because it, in a way, this is the site that started it all. </p>
