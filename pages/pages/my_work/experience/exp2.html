				<h1>Engineering Intern</h1>
				<p>Omtool, Ltd. | Andover, MA <br/>
				   May 2014  -  January 2015 <br/> 
				   { 8 months } </p>
				<p>This job was my first experience working at a real
				   company.  My uncle, who is a software engineer Omtool, was 
				   my mentor for my senior project, and was so happy <br/>
				   with my work that at the end I was offered an internship 
				   at his company. I worked here the summer after my senior 
				   year of high school, and my during my first winter <br/>
				   break at college.  The breaks in my employment were <br/> 
				   so I could focus on my education. </p>
				<p>During my time at Omtool, in which I was very new <br/>
				   to writing code, I helped design, develop, implement, and 
				   maintain automated UI tests for existing programs <br/>
				   by using QAlibers Test Builder, a drag and drop, <br/>
				   slightly outdated test building program.  I also 
				   participated in weekly SCRUM meetings, and was able 
				   to communicate and collaborate insightfully and 
				   effectively with my coworkers. </p>
				<p>There is so much that I learned at Omtool, the biggest 
				   thing perhaps being simply how it feels to work at a  
				   company.  Having coworkers and interacting <br/>
				   with them, and seeing how they interact with each other 
				   to fix bugs and build a project and work towards a goal 
				   was really cool.  Familiarizing myself with all of the 
				   stages of writing, reviewing, testing, and pushing code to 
				   a version control system was also super valuable. In 
				   addition, working primarily with a nearly obsolete 
				   program required a lot of dedication, motivation, and 
				   independant research, which showed me that I can work 
				   successfully on my own to teach myself new skills. </p>
