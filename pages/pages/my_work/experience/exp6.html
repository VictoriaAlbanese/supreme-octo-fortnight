				<h1>Software Engineering Intern</h1>
				<p>Symbotic LLC | Wilmington, MA <br/>
				   June 2016  -  Present <br/> 
				   { Starting Soon! } </p>
				<p>I am so completely excited to start working at Symbotic! </p>
				<p>The people that I met there are so amazing, the facilities
				   are excellent, and the robots are super cool. </p>
				<p>I am in the Co-op Scholars program at the University of
				   Massachusetts Lowell, and it is through this program that 
				   I got my summer job.  I attended an informational session
				   about the company, and had the excellent opportunity to do 
				   a one-on-one resume review with Chad Gambino (now my boss).
				   Chad gave me some useful tips and asked me some concept 
				   questions, and was impressed enough to invite me to do an
				   interview at Symbotic the following Tuesday, which I eagerly
				   accepted.  After interviewing with some of the head software
				   engineers and touring the facilities, a few days later I was 
				   offered the job, which I obviously accepted! </p>
				<p>As of today, I have not yet started work, but I will 
				   extremely soon, and once I've completed a few weeks and 
				   gotten a good hold of my work, I will come back and update 
				   this lovely website. </p>
				<p>I know I will learn a lot, and I hope I can contribute
				   meaningfully to the company.</p>
