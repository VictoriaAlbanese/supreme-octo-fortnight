				<h1>Robotics Intern</h1>
				<p>UMass Lowell Robotics Lab | Lowell, MA <br/>
				   June 2013  -  August 2014 <br/> 
				   { 3 months } </p>
				<p>When I was accepted to the University of Massachusetts 
				   Lowell, I was awarded a scholarship where I would co-op 
				   with one of the professors for 10 weeks over the summer 
				   and in turn be paid $4000.  I was so beyond excited when 
				   a spot at the robotics lab and the opportunity to work 
				   under Holly Yanco opened up! As a result of this job, <br/>
				   I got offered my next job during my next <br/>
				   semester in school.</p>
				<p>In the lab, my coworker, 
				   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderinfantino">Alexander Infantino</a>
				   , and I designed and developed programs written in C++ which 
				   enable a NAO Robot to detect and react to its 
				   environment with its sensors, and to perform specific 
				   tasks, including standing up when it has fallen down, 
				   avoiding obstacles when navigating a room, walking, 
				   talking, and even hula dancing!  All of this was 
				   implemented utilizing Robot Operating System (ROS) 
				   on a Linux operating system. </p>
				<p>I learned so many skills at this job.  Not only did I really 
				   get to excercise my knowledge of coding that I had, by 
				   that time, built up, but I really got to expand and refine 
				   my ability to work in a linux environment.  Learning to 
				   use vim and Github was really valuable, and using ROS, 
				   the most widely used platform for robots, will definitely
				   come in very useful during the course of my career.
				   Above all, the opportunity to work with robots in such a
			           hands-on environment really enforced to me that 
				   robotics is a path that I'm very interested in following. </p>
